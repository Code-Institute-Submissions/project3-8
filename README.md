# README.md
This is the start of my project.
I have done some bits already as I was doing test tasks while I was followingthe videos and doing the mini projects.
Some git commits will be quick as a result.


# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to deliver a website that showcases the technology we have been learning and to incorporate a form that allows customers specify a brief for a full stack development and an admin back end to reply and edit the quotes.
The 'CRM' system will be a number of forms that the customer can enter a brief for a full stack development project.
The system will also have a back end to view ,edit and respond to the briefs recieved.
