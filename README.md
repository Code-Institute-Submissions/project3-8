# FULLSTACK CRM

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to deliver a website that showcases the technology we have been learning and to incorporate a form that allows customers specify a brief for a full stack development.
The site has an admin back end to reply and edit the quotes.
The 'CRM' system will be a number of forms that the customer can enter a brief for a full stack development project.
The system back end allows the company FULLSTACK to view ,edit and respond to the project briefs recieved.
The peoject quotes are kept in a mongo DB and can be upadted and emails sent to the customer with further information on the project.
The website is aimed at companies requiring full stack development services.
The portfolio feature lists a number of full stack tech and further information is available by selecting a card.


##  UX - User Experience

### User stories
I want user to be informed about full stack development and to request a quote for a full stack project. 
I envisage a customer looking for full stack project providers to visit the site and get all the information they need.
The customer can use the New quote form to complete  a project brief that can be responded to by Full stack.

As a user type, I want to learn more about full stack development and make contact with FULLSTACK to start a conversation.
Seee the links below for data schema etc.

### Navigation
The navigation is based on a top bootstrap menu with some further menues in the quote pages.
I plan to use pills in the page that displays the quotes

### UX design
I modified a bootstrap template that I am fanmiliar with for information pages and designed all the forms with bootsrap.
I wanted to use different input types to collect the information on the forms.

### Responsive Design
I have used bootsrap throughout the project. The page elements look well on screens as small as 360 pixels wide and as big as 3840 pixels wide (4K).	Bootstrap grid sizes and CSS3 media queries  are used to ensure the layout changes appropriately and reflows when the screen is resized.

### Static JSON file driven Features
- Portfolio page, connected to static json fil
I am using a static JSON file in my data directory to drive my portfolio pages.
I will put this in a mongodb later , it was just quicker to import everyting from a json file 
  - Portfolio page list all the Full stack portfolio we work on and these are taken from the JSON file.
  - The filter tabs are driven form the JSON file and are  used to call css classes for display.
  - Each card then calls a member route and loads the description etc. form the JSOM.
  - This can be easily converted to a DB as all the json work has been done
- 
.
### Future Features.
- DB driven portfolio pages
- Quote search facility by tech type, Live Date etc
- 

## Technologies Used

    JavaScriptJQuery - email sending
    Bootstrap - template
    Font Awesome - used in the template for icons etc
    Animate - template animation

### Testing
I tested the app as I was developing. 
I use the debugger in vscode to follow my code to look for errors.
I found that devloping some funtion first in python only and integrating with the HTML/Jinja when they were working 
helped me identify issues quicker.


### Information Architecture
I have used a number of ways to pass information into my website and application.
- Setting python variables
I have created a number of variable and pass them in the render template call to make it easy to customise my website.
see the nav.html where i customise the hero image and text with variables called in jinja.
- Static json text
I created a static json text file and this drives the tech portfolio pages
- Mongo Database
The Quote and contact page information is stored in a Mongo database
The data schema is located at https://github.com/ciaranq/project3/blob/master/static/CRM-schema.pdf

### Directory Structure and File Naming
- The python file to run the flask app is in the root.
- Static directory contains the following
  - CSS : Main css file with my modifications
  - Javascript : Main js file with the sendmail and sendquote scripts.
  - img : Image files
  - lib : Contains downloaded libraries for the temmplate and bootstrap

#### PEP8
I installed the pep8 linter in vscode and also used an online pep8 checker.
The lines that pass content into the pages are too long ie >80 chars for the pep8 standard.
I placed '# noqa' after these lines to tell the checker to ignore these lines.


## Deployment

## Heroku
The project and my app has been uploaded to Heroku for deployment. I initially setup Heroku as a git remote and uploaded directly.
Auto deploy from GITHUB to heroku is now enabled.
